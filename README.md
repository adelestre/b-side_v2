# B-Side Music

## Presentation
B-Side Music is a project I started on October 2021. It was originally named Library Independant And Musical and was developped in plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS. I released then in November a new version with a brand new design made by Sami Guemmi and a new name (B-Side Music). Finally, on May 2022, I decided to migrate the project to React and leave plain JavaScript.

## Specifications
This project although originally made in plain JavaScript, is now powered by React. It's using Firebase services for hosting, authentication and database management / access.
